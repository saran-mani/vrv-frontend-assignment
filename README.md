## Security Measures 

### Frontend Security
1. **Token Storage:**
   - User tokens are securely stored in `localStorage` to maintain authentication state.
   - Sensitive data is not exposed to the frontend.

2. **Route Protection:**
   - Implemented a `ProtectedRoute` component to ensure only authenticated users can access specific routes like `/home`.
   - Users without valid tokens are automatically redirected to the `/signin` page.

3. **Validation:**
   - Input validation on the client side prevents malformed data from being sent to the server.
   - Prevents submission of empty or invalid email and password fields during sign-up and login.

### Backend Security
1. **API Authentication:**
   - Token-based authentication implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
   - Tokens are validated on every request to secure endpoints.

2. **Password Encryption:**
   - Passwords are hashed using algorithms like `bcrypt` before storing them in the database.
   - Plaintext passwords are never stored.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Detailed error messages are only provided to authenticated users or logged securely on the backend.
   - General error messages are shown to unauthorized users to prevent information disclosure.

4. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):**
   - Configured CORS policies to only allow requests from trusted origins.

5. **Rate Limiting and Throttling:**
   - Prevents brute-force attacks by limiting the number of login attempts from a single IP address.

6. **Input Sanitization:**
   - All user input is sanitized to prevent SQL and NoSQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

## Best Practices Followed
1. **Token Expiry:**
   - JWT tokens have an expiration time to minimize risks if compromised.
   - Users need to re-authenticate after the token expires.

2. **Session Management:**
   - Tokens are cleared from `localStorage` upon user logout.

- **Create a blog**: `POST api/v1/blog`
- **Edit a blog**: `PATCH api/v1/blog/:blogId`
- **Delete a blog**: `DELETE api/v1/blog/:blogId`
